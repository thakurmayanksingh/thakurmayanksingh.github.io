    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">Hello! I'm a 21-year-old with a curious, slightly sardonic heart who has a strong passion for music, animals, and the outdoors.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">Perhaps it's my serene demeanor or the fact that I truly care, but I've always been the type of person who others open up to. I think it's important to support people in difficult times as well as in pleasant ones. My friends refer to me as the mature person who always puts the needs of others before their own. They're also not incorrect.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">I have a special place in my heart for dogs, and if I'm by myself, you can probably find me strolling around a green space or losing myself in music. Nature is my reset button, and singing is my therapy.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">Sarcasm, which keeps things light while maintaining a strong sense of groundedness, is my secret sauce since life is too short to be taken too seriously. I cherish sincere discussions, enduring friendships, and the small pleasures in life.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;"><em>I, the dreamer, the listener, the artist, am reflected in this area. I appreciate you coming by. Let's collaborate, communicate, and perhaps even sing a few songs together.</em></p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Interests & Hobbies</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
      My interests are a quirky blend of creativity, compassion, and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
      More than merely a pastime, <strong>singing</strong> has always served as a soulful escape.
      Music keeps my spirit alive, whether Iâ€™m humming through a calm evening or belting out a favorite tune.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
      I engage in <strong>volunteer work for animal welfare</strong> because I hold the belief that animals deserve love, protection, and advocates on their behalf.
      Their presence anchors me and serves as a constant reminder to be kind.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
      I take pleasure in <strong>creating small coding projects</strong> and <strong>exploring open-source tools</strong> to understand their workings.
      It is exciting to solve actual problems with clean, functional code.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
      I enjoy <strong>games that are based on logic</strong>, tech puzzles, and even some casual gaming now and then to refresh my brain
      (and engage in friendly trash-talk with friends!).
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
      I constantly read about <strong>AI, startups, and personal development</strong>.
      I'm all in for anything that challenges my thinking or enhances my way of living.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1rem;">
      My happy place? <strong>Instrumental tunes in the background</strong> as I code or jot down ideas.
